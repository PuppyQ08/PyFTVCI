This is the code for the paper finite-temperature VCI: Xiuyi Qin & So Hirata (2021) Finite-temperature vibrational full configuration interaction, Molecular Physics, 119:21-22, DOI: 10.1080/00268976.2021.1949503

It offers the API of:
* Buiding vibrational FCI matrix for the input molecular potential energy surfaces.
* Evaluate thermodynamic properties such as entropy, grand potential, and internal energy by thermal averaging all the eigenvalues of FCI matrix.
* Evaluate the perturbation corrections to thermodynamic properties by differentiating FCI matrix.
